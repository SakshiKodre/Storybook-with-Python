# Data Science Assignment Submission

Dear TAs,

We have used two languages for our assignment: English and Hindi.

## Instructions

To run the application, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have empty folders that start with "output".
2. Open the `Assignment.ipynb` notebook.
3. Start by installing the required libraries mentioned in the header of the notebook using `pip install`.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook one by one.
5. As you progress through the notebook, you will notice that the OUTPUT folders will start to fill in.
6. Finally, a PDF file will be generated at the end of the execution of the notebook. This file is our final output.

Thank you.
