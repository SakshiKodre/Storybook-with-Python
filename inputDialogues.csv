1,[Earth Government Headquarters]
2,[Government Officials and Military Leaders]
3,[The CARNIVAL MASTER arrives...]
4,"Olivia: ""Not here to destroy us. It’s a cosmic tournament?"""
5,"Megan: ""Great. I’m guessing there’s no warm-up round."""
6,[Government Leaders Staring]
7,"Carnival Master: ""Greetings, inhabitants of Earth. You have been chosen to participate in the Galactic Carnival..."""
8,"[General Hua, a stern military leader]"
9,"Megan: ""Cosmic Olympics. Sounds like fun... until it isn’t."""
10,"Carnival Master: ""...Compete well, or your planet will be forfeit to the winners."""
11,[The Carnival Master’s face as he delivers the final words...]
12,"Olivia: ""It’s not just a game."""
13,"[Confusion and worry among the group, with some checking their tablets and whispering]"
14,"Megan (muttering): ""This is way beyond what I signed up for."""
15,[Sound of static from a transmission showing alien ships surrounding Earth.]
16,"Megan: ""What now? Just roll with it?"""
17,"Olivia: ""We need to understand what we’re dealing with."""
18,"Carnival Master: ""Prepare yourselves for the greatest games in the universe."""
19,"General Hua: ""We have to assume this isn’t a game… This is a test. And we can’t afford to fail."""
20,"Megan: ""Fantastic. Intergalactic sports competition, and we’re the rookies."""
21,"Olivia: ""We need to gather our best minds. This is as much about science as it is about survival."""
22,[Tension and unity—everyone understands the gravity of the situation]
23,[The mood is tense but energized]
24,"Megan (sighing): ""This is either going to be incredible… or a disaster.” Olivia (calmly): ""We won’t know until we see for ourselves."""
25,"Captain Liu: ""Focus. We don’t know what’s coming, but we’re the best Earth has."""
26,[An Alien Trisolaran ship descends]
27,[The sound of wind intensifies as both teams face each other in tense silence.]
28,"Captain Trisa: ""I’m here to ensure my team wins. Don’t get in my way."""
29,"Megan (grinning): ""We don’t bite... unless you do."""
30,"Olivia (whispering, placing a hand on Megan’s arm): ""Let’s not make enemies on day one."""
31,"[The silence stretches as both captains exchange a long, intense stare.]"
32,[Sound of gloves clinking as Captain Trisa reluctantly shakes hands with Captain Liu.]
33,[Megan and Trisa lock eyes.]
34,"[The wind picks up as the two teams stand in a wide circle, still segregated but together in the arena.]"
35,"Olivia (breathless): ""Did I miss the handshake? Please tell me I didn’t miss the handshake."""
36,"Megan (grinning): ""You missed the handshake, but don’t worry, it was about as warm as a polar vortex."""
37,[Sound of soft whirring as the floating pod carrying the Carnival Representative approaches the group.]
38,"Carnival Representative: ""Welcome, competitors! You’ve been chosen to represent your planets in the great Galactic Carnival. Prepare for the trials ahead."""
39,"[Captain Liu nods, Olivia remains neutral, Megan smirks.]"
40,"[The Trisolarans stand cold and calculated, treating the event as life or death.]"
41,"Olivia (muttering, fidgeting with her tablet): ""We’re totally out of our depth here..."""
42,"Carnival Representative: ""Your first challenge begins tomorrow. Get to know each other… It might just save your lives."""
43,[The representative’s pod quietly floating away]
44,"[Earth and Trisolaran teams arrive on a floating platform in space suits, visibly uncomfortable in the zero-gravity environment. The platform creaks under their weight, metallic clanks echo around them.]"
45,"Megan (wide-eyed, slightly floating): “This feels more like an intergalactic bouncy castle than a race.”"
46,"Olivia (calmly, adjusting her suit): “Focus. This is a test of physics, not just agility.”"
47,"[Trisolarans prepare with military precision, already familiar with zero gravity, their stabilizers glowing slightly.]"
48,"Carnival Master: ""Welcome to your first challenge. The Zero Gravity Obstacle Course. The rules are simple: reach the finish line, or be disqualified."""
49,"[Earth team members look uneasy. Olivia remains focused while Megan hovers awkwardly, adjusting her balance.]"
50,"Captain Trisa (sternly to her team): ""Stick to the plan. We can’t afford to lose here."""
51,Megan (grinning): “Do we even have a plan?”
52,"Olivia (glancing at her tablet): “Technically, yes... if not dying counts as a plan.”"
53,"[The starting line lights up with a digital countdown, beeping rhythmically as it ticks down from 5.]"
54,"Olivia (focused, gripping a handrail): ""Just follow the physics."""
55,[The teams launch from the platform as the countdown reaches zero]
56,"Megan (flailing as she misses her footing, spinning uncontrollably): “I’m no astronaut!”"
57,"[Megan struggles to get her balance as the others advance. She grabs onto a floating platform but falls behind as the race intensifies.] Megan (frustrated, muttering): “Great. Of course, I’d mess this up.”"
58,"[Captain Trisa and her team glide effortlessly through the obstacles, barely touching the walls. They have a clear lead now.]"
59,"[Determined, Olivia angles her body carefully, using small, calculated movements to bypass spinning laser walls. She pushes forward to make up for Megan’s fall.] Olivia (gritting her teeth, focused): “Come on...”"
60,"[Olivia propels herself forward, trying to catch up to the Trisolaran team. She gets closer, dodging the final floating rocks and spinning hoops, but Trisa maintains her lead, gliding effortlessly through the final obstacles.]"
61,"[Trisa crosses the glowing finish line, victorious, just seconds ahead of Olivia. The glow from the finish line intensifies as the race ends. Olivia lands with a heavy thud, slightly disappointed but still focused.]"
62,"Carnival Master: “Congratulations, Captain Trisa! A well-earned victory for Trisolaris.” [The Carnival Master’s voice is booming, echoing across the arena. Trisa’s team nods, satisfied with their performance.]"
63,"Olivia (catching her breath, focused): “Next time. We’ll be ready.” [She glances at the course, already analyzing what went wrong, her mind working on strategies for the next challenge.]"
64,"Megan: ""That... was insane. I’ve never been more grateful for solid ground."""
65,"Olivia: ""We wouldn’t have made it without you.” Captain Trisa: ""Likewise."""
66,"Olivia: ""This place… it feels different. The laws of physics are stable here."""
67," Megan: ""Who knew intergalactic survival games would be this exhausting?"""
68,"Captain Trisa: ""For once, a moment to breathe."""
69,"Olivia: ""That last puzzle was designed to collapse. It wasn’t about solving it—it was a trap."""
70,"Captain Trisa: ""We barely made it out. The Carnival Master is toying with us."""
71,"Carnival Master (in his head): ""You’ll find out soon enough..."""
72,"Megan: “Alright, Trisa, let’s see if you're as sharp with puzzles as you are with your ship.”"
73,"Trisa: “This isn’t just a game, Megan. Precision is key.”"
74,Trisa: “I did it!” Megan: “Just in time. Well played”
75,Trisa: “This tower is going to be my masterpiece!”
76,Megan: “Masterpiece or disaster? Let’s see how long it stands!”
77,"Olivia: “Careful, both of you! Remember, it’s about stability!”"
78,Megan: “Easy does it… just like that!”
79,Trisa: “Watch it! One wrong move could mean disaster!”
80,[the tower finally collapses]
81,[Expression says it all: the thrill of competition]
82,"[In a moment of triumph and terror, the tower comes crashing down—strategy and skill put to the ultimate test!]"
83,Megan: “You ready for this?” Trisa: “Let’s see if you can back up that confidence.”
84,Olivia: “Pool’s all about geometry and angles… just like solving a puzzle.”
85,"Trisa: “Don’t get too comfortable, Earthling. I’ve played this before.”"
86,Megan: “This one’s for the win.”
87,[Thud as the ball drops into the pocket]
88,Carnival Master (thinking to himself): “They may think they’re in control... but I’m the one holding the strings.”
89,"Trisa: ""He’s been pulling the strings… all along."""
90,"Megan: ""I should’ve known... every win, every loss—it’s been his game."""
91,"Olivia: ""Trisa’s right. It’s not just competition. He’s playing with us."""
92,"Trisa: ""Then we stop playing by his rules. We unite, and we choose peace."""
93,"Megan: ""Together, we’re stronger than him. No more division."""
94,"Olivia: ""We end his control. It’s time to break free."""
95,"Carnival Master (thinking): ""They’ve finally figured it out. But they won’t break my game."""
96,"Megan: ""We’re in this together now."""
97,"Team Trisolaran Member: ""We fight together, Earth and Trisolaris, for our future."""
98,"Trisa: ""This is the beginning of something new."""
99,"Carnival Master (muttering): ""They’re changing the game…"""
100,"""United, they chose peace over rivalry. Together, they were unstoppable."""
